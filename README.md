# !! My First functional program :) !!!
## In this project I tried to deepen my knowledge in python to create an application that facilitates date management.

To execute it is necessary to have Lib

 from tkinter import *
 
 from tkinter import ttk
 
 from time import strftime
 
 import sqlite3
 
 from tkcalendar import Calendar
