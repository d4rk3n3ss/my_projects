# !! My First functional program :) !!!
In this project I tried to deepen my knowledge in python to create an application that facilitates date management.

To execute it is necessary to have Lib

from tkinter import *
from tkinter import ttk
from time import strftime
import sqlite3
from tkcalendar import Calendar


Explaining the interface




First Button

Register with name, phone, email and the date itself


Second Button:

Displays records with dates on the current day


Third Button:

Shows all records made in the current month,

Having the possibility to change the entries made.
