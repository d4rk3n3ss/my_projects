In this project I tried to deepen my knowledge in python to create an application that facilitates date management.

Explaining the interface




First Boot

Register with name, phone, email and the date itself


Second Botao:

Displays records with dates on the current day


Third Button:

Shows all records made in the current month,

Having the possibility to change the entries made.
